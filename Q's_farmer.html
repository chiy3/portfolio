		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p>Q's Farmer App is an app more than a traditional digital marketplace. It provides a platform for farmers and customers to trade and communication. Moreover, it aims to maintain social ties between farmers and customers in both the digital and the real world. The project includes a complete process of UX research, solution ideation and UI design. I did the research part as a group and the design part by myself. </p>

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Background</h2>
		<span class="animated wow fadeInUp">A farmers' market is a physical retail marketplace intended to sell foods directly by farmers to customers. There are several benefits to farmers’ markets. For example, by directly selling products to the customers, farmers gain more profits than selling it to wholesalers, food processors, or large grocery firms. Customers also receive fresher and healthier foods meanwhile reduce the cost and pollution. <br><br>

		Farmers hold different kinds of events for people to get closer to nature and deliver knowledge of our daily food to everyone. For instance, A small farm in Austin cooperates with schools to teach kids where our food comes from and teach them how to grow their own plants. In other words, farms play the role of educators and provide a space for leisure. </span>	

		<img class="animated wow fadeInUp" src="work/img/IMG_4625.jpg">

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Challenge</h2>
		<span class="animated wow fadeInUp"> For small and medium-scale farmers, they have trouble maintaining their inventory due to several reasons. They also suffer from unnecessary losses because of the characteristics of fresh vegetable and fruit. Thus, farmers seek a new way to sell their items to customers, meet customer’s needs and also maintain the social connection at the same time. </span>

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Research Questions</h2>
		<p class="animated wow fadeInUp">How to duplicate the experience of farmers market from real world to digtial world? <br> What are the main goal and pain point of farmer and customer?<br>What’s the specialty and uniqueness of farmers market?</p>

		<h1 class="animated wow fadeInUp">User Research</h1>

		<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
		<h2>Contextual Inquiry & Observations</h2>
		<span>We conducted contextual inquiries on farmers and customers in the farmers' market. By observing their interaction directly and recording their attitude, mood, reaction during real tasks, it brought us the information we couldn’t retrieve from the interviews. Through notes, photos and videos from different interviewers and perspectives, we were able to discuss and integrate the opinions afterward and finally catch the core values of that users care.
			<br><br>
		We used an affinity diagram to list our notes.<br><br></span></div>

		<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">		
		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<span>We conducted 7 semi-structured interviews as well, including the manager of 1 medium-scale farm, 2 farmers and 4 customers. We regarded the manager of the medium-scale farm as a key informant who can provide us the most insights about farmers. Moreover, we interviewed 4 different types of customers as well. Different from contextual inquiry, semi-structured interviews provided us information in a narrow scale. With the information in a restricted scale, we spotted the common difficulties or problems that customers face in traditional farmers' markets.</span>

		<h1 class="animated wow fadeInUp">What We Found</h1>



		
		<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">		
		<h2>Communication between framer and customer</h2>
		<span>The communication between framers and customers can be messy and intricate and it usually included several channels and platforms. As you can see below: </span>

	<h2>Core values that customer cares </h2>
	<span>Deprived from contextual inquiries and interviews, we defined three core values that the customer cares the most.</span>
	</div>

	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Flexibility"</p>

	<p class="c">Customers desire <strong><i>flexibility</i></strong> about the schedule of farmers' markets. There is usually a fixed schedule of farmers' markets. For example, the farmers' markets in Austin are held on Sunday from 10:00 am to 2 pm at Browning Hangar Park. However, not everyone is always available at that time. Thus, the customer seeks some flexibility to buy items at different times and locations. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Convenience"</p>

	<p class="c">A customer seeks <strong><i>convenience</i></strong> when it comes to ordering products from farmers. Traditionally, customers can either make a phone call or go to the farm directly to order products. Nonetheless, there are only few or even only one worker on the farm during the weekday. Most of the time, they are all working on the farm instead of staying in the office and waiting for a phone call. Thus, making an order is a pain point for customers.</p>  
	</div>
	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Predictability"</p>

	<p class="c">Customers care about <strong><i>what kinds of products will they have in this week's market</i></strong>. Customers look for information for them to do other decisions since they still purchase fresh goods from other marketplaces. If they can know what will farmers have in this week's farmers market earlier, they will have a clear plan of what should buy or not buy during other shopping.</p>

	<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
	<span>At the first of ideation, we started from discussing with the farmers. We all agreed that mobile app is the option with the most potential. Next, we did brainstorm to come up with what functions shall we include in our app. </span>

	<span>Based on our research, we came out of 50+ function first and chose those fitted the most in our user flow. Over iterate over and over, we came out of five functions.<br><br>

	<div class="wow animated fadeIn">
	
		<h2>Five Main Functions</h2>
		<div class="function-row">

		<div class="function-img"><img src="work/img/qj-recipes.svg"></div><div class="function-text"><p>Users have to cook almost everything that buy from the farm. Therefore, recipe serves as an useful tool to attract users to come back after purchasing</p></div></div>

	<h2>Three Goals</h2>	
	<span>We listed three goals as well:<br></span>


	<p class="goals">•	Design an intuitive and user-friendly experience that users can efficiently place their order or reserve for events <br><br>
	•	Provide a platform which allows farmers to update and sell their inventory easily and efficiently<br><br>
	•	Create and maintain connection between customer and farmer</strong><br></p>

	<span>Based on our main functions and goals, we made our first wireframe.</span>

		<h1>Wireframe and Prototype</h1>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<span>According to unpredictable supplements, I have orders start from pending status after customers placing their orders. The farm has to confirm that all of the items in the order are available and then click “confirm order” button to accept the order. I also designed a message section for customers and farmers to communicate directly and efficiently. </span>

		<h1>User Testing</h1>
		<p>Conducting user testing is always the most direct way to validate my design and I conducted two rounds of user testing. <br><br>

        The first round was testing the task flow and information architecture with wireframes. In order to discover potential breakdown and deadlock before hi-fi prototypes, I conducted paper prototype testing with lo-fi wireframes, it helps users to focus on fundamental flow, information architecture and users' needs without distracting them by images, colors, etc. <br><br>

        
        The second round was testing the whole app with hi-fi clickable prototypes on Figma. By observing users perform each task while thinking out loud, I received direct feedback and thoughts about what's working for them, what isn’t. Users' opinions are very valuable to me.  In this way, I found specific ways to improve users' experience. 

        <br><br>After revising over and over, I came out with the final interactive prototype as you saw above.

<p><strong>“Connection between people” is always the first priority in the development of this app. </strong></p>


<span>
One of the biggest benefits of local farmers' markets is to create social ties and link people together. Farmers' markets help create distinction and uniqueness, which can increase pride and encourage residents to engage in community. However, this kind of connection may be easily destroyed by the Internet. Thus, how to maintain this connection is my first priority. In the future, the function for customers to choose products with different levels of ripeness will be helpful. I hope farmers' markets could grow into a hub of a community where people can find healthy foods and a wealthy mood.
