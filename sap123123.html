	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p><a href="https://www.sapstore.com/" target="blank">SAP Store</a> - is an online shop for SAP Products built by SAP.</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.sapappcenter.com/en/" target="blank">SAP AppCenter</a> - is a marketplace where companies buy and try products built by SAP Partners. These products usually extend SAP Product functionality in some way.</p>  
	<p>
	For example, imagine that there was an SAP Product where you could store all the information about a TV you manufactured, including the current warranty for the TV (assume this is called ‚ÄúSAP Manufacturing Database‚Äù.)  However, the product didn‚Äôt have anywhere to handle different versions of the TV warranty.  In this case an SAP Partner built an extension to the product that allowed for the customer to store multiple versions of the TV warranty (assume this is called ‚ÄúWarranty Extender for SAP‚Äù.) In this example, ‚ÄúSAP Manufactoring Database‚Äù is the type of product that would sell on SAP Store and ‚ÄúWarrenty Extender for SAP‚Äù is the type of product that would sell on SAP AppCenter.</p>

	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p class="challenge">"Design the search function for SAP customers on a combined website of SAP Store and SAP AppCenter"</p>
	
	<h2>Process</h2>

	<h2>Understand - Challenge</h2>
	<p>In order to better understand the challenge, I deconstructed the challenge into several questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Why is search function important?</li>
			<li>What problem are we trying to solve?</li>
			<li>How does this function benefit customers?</li> 
			<li>How does this function benefit SAP?</li>
			<li>What business opportunity does it create?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>After researching SAP Store and SPA AppCenter, I found the answers to the questions: <br> 
	     <strong>The search function is the most straightforward method for users to find what they want</strong> among 100+ products on SAP Store and 1000+ products on SAP AppCenter. Although these two websites are highly related to each other, <strong>there's no way to navigate from one to the other.</strong> Thus, by combing SAP Store and SAP AppCenter, <strong>it saves time and effort for customers to find products in one place instead of two</strong>. For SAP, <strong>it saves the cost of maintaining two individual websites.</strong> Moreover, <strong>there's an opportunity to promote related products which lead to revenue rising.</strong> </p>
