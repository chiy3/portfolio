		<h2> Overview </h2>
		<p>It is an app aims to provide a platform which allows consumers to pre-order/order products and reserve events of QJ farm and also allows QJ Farm to update their inventory and events easily. The project includes complete process of ux research, solution ideation and ui design. We’ve conduct over 100+ hour in field research and it is one of our proposals.  </p>

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Background</h2>
		<span class="animated wow fadeInUp">CSA is abbreviation of “Community-Supported Agriculture”. It is an alternative socioeconomic model of agriculture and food distribution that allows the producer and consumer to share risks of farming. When consumers sharing risks with QJ CSA Farm, they gain organic and eco-friendly farm products as return. 
		<br><br>
		QJ CSA Farm is a small/medium scale farm located at the edge of city. It practices organic and eco-friendly agriculture without pesticide and chemistry involved. People can drive there from downtown within 30 minutes. There are two goals of QJ Farm. First one is to create stable income and job opportunity for urban indigenous people. Second one is to provide a place where people can get touch with nature and learn the knowledge of our daily food.  </span>	

		<img class="animated wow fadeInUp" src="work/img/IMG_4625.jpg">

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Challenge</h2>
		<span class="animated wow fadeInUp">Generally speaking, CSA farm offers consumers regular farm products on a subscription or membership basis. Consumers pay same fee and receive products without choosing what they want and stable product amount. If there is a rich harvest, consumers will receive more products than usual. On the other hand, they will receive less products after natural disasters. It is the way how consumers share risks with the farm. During the time we did field research there, the subscription number was decreasing. It had brought the manager to consider to seek for some change.  </span>

		<h2 class="animated wow fadeInUp">Research Questions</h2>
		<p class="animated wow fadeInUp"> Why do the subscription number decline?<br>What is the main goal and pain point of QJ Farm and their costumers?<br>How to share risk with customers without subscription?<br>What’s the specialty and unique of QJ Farm?</p>

		<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
		<h2>Contextual Inquiry & Observations</h2>
		<span>As part of field study, we mainly relied on contextual inquiry to gain insight of users. We not only conducted contextual inquiries on all farmers at QJ farm but also conducted it on 2 event attendants and customers. By observing users directly and recording their attitude, mood, reaction during real tasks, it brought us the information we couldn’t retrieve from interview. Through notes, photos and videos from different person and perspectives, we were able to discuss and integrate the opinions afterward and finally catch the core values of that users care.
			<br><br>
		We use affinity diagram to list our notes.<br><br></span></div>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<span>We conducted 4 semi-structured interview as well, including the manager of QJ farm and three consumers. The manager had been worked at the farm 3 years and one interviewee had been consumer of the farm for over 1 year, the others two had been consumer for less 1 year. Different from contextual inquiry, semi-structured interview provided us information within a narrow scale. With the information in a restricted scale, we spotted the common difficulties or problems that users would face during tasks. <br></span>

		<h1 class="animated wow fadeInUp">What We Found</h1>

	<h2>Core values that user cares </h2>
	<span>Deprived from contextual inquiries and interviews, we defined three core values that user cares the most.</span>
	</div>

	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Flexibility"</p>

	<p class="c">User desires <I><b>flexibility</b></I> about the regular received products from QJ Farm. Users want to choose what and when they will receive each time. For example, during summer or winter break, family usually go on a trip for a longer period of time than usual. However, They still receive the regular products even if they aren’t at home because they cannot cease the subscription for a short period of time.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Convenience"</p>

	<p class="c">User seeks <I><strong>convenience</strong></I> when it comes to order food from QJ Farm. In traditional way, consumers can either make a phone call or go to the farm directly to order products. Nonetheless, there is only 5 workers including manager in the farm during week day. At most of time, they all working in the farm instead of staying in the office. Consumers usually have troubles to make an order.</p>  
	</div>
	<div class="animated wow fadeInUp">
	<p class="t">"Predictability"</p>

	<p class="c">User cares about <I><strong>what will they receive recently</strong></I>. Although QJ Farm notifies consumers one day before their regular receiving, consumers look for more information for them to do other decisions. Consumers still purchase fresh goods from other marketplace. If they can know how many and what will they receive from QJ Farm earlier, they will have a plan of what should buy or not buy during other shopping.</p>

	<h2>Three Goals</h2>	
	<span>We listed three goals as well:<br></span>


	<p>•	Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface so that users can efficiently place their order or reserve for events <br><br>
	•	Provide a platform which allows QJ Farm to update and sell their inventory easily and effectively<br><br>
	•	Create connection between consumer and producer</strong><br></p>

		<h1>Wireframe and Prototype</h1>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<span>According to unpredictable supplement and pre-order, we have orders start from pending status after consumers placing their orders. The farm has to confirm that all of items in the order are available and then click “confirm order” button to accept the order. We also designed a message section for consumers and producer to communicate directly and efficiently. </span>

		<h2>Paper prototying </h2>
		<span>In order to discover potential breakdowns before hi-fi interface, we conducted paper prototype testing. With lo-fi wireframe, it helps users to focus on the flow of task and their needs. Here were some of what we found: <br><br>

		•	The location of cart is different from user’s experience on goods page<br>
		•	“Cart” section is confusing for the farm manipulating<br>
		•	The location of cart is different from user’s experience<br>
		•	Should search function be included<br>
		•	Should there be filter for items and events<br><br>

		<br>After revising over and over, we made our first interactive prototype.

<p><strong>“Connection between people” is always the first priority in the development of this app. </strong></p>


<span>


I gained a ton of insight into research and design from the special context fo QJ Farm. After researching markets and competitors of QJ Farm, I realized that it was a huge challenge because of the scale and characteristic of QJ Farm. A small/medium scale farm means that cost of the products is nearly impossible to be as low as large scale farm or mass-produced factory. A toxic-free and organic cultivation means that it takes more time to harvest and leads to unpredictable amount of harvest as well. Both these disadvantage directly reflect on price and amount of the product.  However, QJ Farm invites and welcomes everyone to be part of the farm. Thus, I added message and simulation game as a bridge to build connection. In future, I hope QJ Farm could grow into a community with healthy food and wealthy mood.
